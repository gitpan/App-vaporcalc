Shake well! Some ingredients may separate from solution.

STEEPING:

These liquids are steeped under light heat for at least 12 hours before
bottling -- but many flavors improve given extra time to steep.

Pop the cap off and leave it in a warm place, away from children and pets.

You may find the flavor profile changes drastically from one day to the next.

INGREDIENTS:

  * Vegetable Glycerin
  * Propylene Glycol
  * Nicotine
  * Flavor concentrate 
    (may contain trace amounts of ethyl alcohol; steep to evaporate)
  * May contain ethyl maltol (sweetener)

Care has been taken to avoid potentially harmful flavor ingredients.
Some people will still experience sensitivity to propylene glycol (PG),
typically in the form of minor throat irritation.

These liquids NEVER contain:

  - Diacetyl
    (causes Bronchiolitis obliterans aka "popcorn lung")
  - Acetoin 
    (ferments to create diacetyl)
